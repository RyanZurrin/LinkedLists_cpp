# LinkedLists_cpp

For this program you will need to implement an instance of an unsorted linked list an a sorted linked list. Please note that each class object needs to be in a separated 
into two header files one that defines the class and one that defines the member functions.  You will also need another header file to define the struct aka the node. 
Hence, you will have five distinct header files.

Your main program (the cpp) will need to create an instance of the usll and the sll that you will load with integer values.  The values that aree going to be loaded will
be in a file named numbers.dat, there will be one number per line in the file I use to test your code.  So you should create a file in the same manner.  Make sure that you 
verify the file was opened before you start reading from it! When you start reading from the the file you should load both linked lists at the same time.  I am looking for 
a menu system similar to this so I can interact with your linked lists.

Menu

===========================

1) Load both lists

2) Display both lists and the quantity of elements

3) Delete item from both lists

4) Empty unsorted linked list

5) Empty sorted linked list

6) Exit program
